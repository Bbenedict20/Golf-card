This app was a lot of fun to build! Golfing has recently become one of my favorite things to do in my free time and I though this would be a fun way to explore a CRUD application with users. I built this using a react frontend, an express backend, and connected it to MongoDB. This app allows you to create a new user, then add courses and rounds to keep track of your personal data! You can all check your stats for either eighteen or nine hole rounds. I learned a lot creating this and has made me feel much more confident in my abilities. One of the biggest challenges I faced was creating the database with all of the users, and then accessing their different datasets. This was my first time building something this complex, but after some trial and error I was able to figure everything out.
